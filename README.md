possible segments for https://www.twitch.tv/benawad

## Current Ideas

### Teaching someone how to code

- Requires the person being taught to be clickbaitable

### Dev Debate

1. Some how a topic is picked (Tabs vs Spaces)
2. I debate someone for a max of 30 minutes
3. At the end of Twitch chat votes who won
4. If I win the other person has to sub to me on Twitch otherwise I have to PayPal them $20

### Tech News

- I go over today's HN & Reddit posts

I'll be adding more ideas here as I think of them.

## Ideas that don't work

### Pair programming with random person

- Seems to always turn out meh. Either the person is boring, the question they ask is boring, they have trouble setting up their dev env, they have a slow computer, etc... You do get some good ones mixed in there, but it's rare.

### Coding on a project

It would be great if this was an option, but is pretty meh until you're a HUGE streamer.
