possible segments for https://www.twitch.tv/benawad

## Current Ideas

### Teaching someone how to code

- works best with other streamers/youtubers or girls

#### Best Practices

- Someone teaching me how to code doesn't work as well
- Doing this with other programmers doesn't work as well because it gets too serious/advanced

## Maybe try

- play fortnite duos with Dan Abramov bro please

- Mentoring random person

## Sometimes

### Dev Debate

1. Some how a topic is picked (Microservices vs. Monolith)
2. I debate someone for a max of 30 minutes
3. At the end of Twitch chat votes who won
4. If I win the other person has to sub to me on Twitch otherwise I have to PayPal them $20

note: a stake is required, but you can pick a different one if you want

main problem: no clear objective | how does twitch chat vote (there is currently no criteria) | unprepared 

## Ideas that don't work


### Tech News

- I go over today's HN & Reddit posts
- I'm not really too interested in doing this // maybe if a good news topic came up


### Learning a programming language

- Hard to follow

### Pair programming with random person

- Seems to always turn out meh. Either the person is boring, the question they ask is boring, they have trouble setting up their dev env, they have a slow computer, I don't know the programming language, etc... 
- You do get some good ones mixed in there, but it's rare.

### Coding on a project

It would be great if this was an option, but it's pretty meh until you're a HUGE streamer.
